## 16.60 SCOPE: REDUCE source code optimization package

`scope` is a package for the production of an optimized form of a set of expressions. It applies an heuristic search for common (sub)expressions to almost any set of proper REDUCE assignment statements. The output is obtained as a sequence of assignment statements. GENTRAN is used to facilitate expression output.
