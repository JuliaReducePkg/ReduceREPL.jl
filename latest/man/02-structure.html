These commands are built up from declarations, statements and expressions. Such entities are composed of sequences of numbers, variables, operators, strings, reserved words and delimiters (such as commas and parentheses), which in turn are sequences of basic characters.</p><ul></ul><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".1-The-REDUCE-Standard-Character-Set-1" href="#.1-The-REDUCE-Standard-Character-Set-1">2.1 The REDUCE Standard Character Set</a></h2><p>The basic characters which are used to build REDUCE symbols are the following:</p><ol><li><p>The 26 letters <code>a</code> through <code>z</code></p></li><li><p>The 10 decimal digits <code>0</code> through <code>9</code></p></li><li><p>The special characters <code>_ ! ~ $ % ’ ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; &gt; = { }⟨blank⟩</code></p></li></ol><p>With the exception of strings and characters preceded by an exclamation mark, the case of characters is ignored: depending of the underlying LISP they will all be converted internally into lower case or upper case: <code>ALPHA</code>, <code>Alpha</code> and <code>alpha</code> represent the same symbol. Most implementations allow you to switch this conversion off. The operating instructions for a particular implementation should be consulted on this point. For portability, we shall limit ourselves to the standard character set in this exposition.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".2-Numbers-1" href="#.2-Numbers-1">2.2 Numbers</a></h2><p>There are several different types of numbers available in REDUCE. Integers consist of a signed or unsigned sequence of decimal digits written without a decimal point, for example:</p><pre><code class="language-none">-2, 5396, +32</code></pre><p>In principle, there is no practical limit on the number of digits permitted as exact arithmetic is used in most implementations. (You should however check the specific instructions for your particular system implementation to make sure that this is true.) For example, if you ask for the value of <span>$2^{2000}$</span> you get it displayed as a number of 603 decimal digits, taking up several lines of output on an interactive display. It should be borne in mind of course that computations with such long numbers can be quite slow.</p><p>Numbers that aren’t integers are usually represented as the quotient of two integers, in lowest terms: that is, as rational numbers.</p><p>In essentially all versions of REDUCE it is also possible (but not always desirable!) to ask REDUCE to work with floating point approximations to numbers again, to any precision. Such numbers are called <em>real</em>. They can be input in two ways:</p><ol><li><p>as a signed or unsigned sequence of any number of decimal digits with an embedded or trailing decimal point.</p></li><li><p>as in 1. followed by a decimal exponent which is written as the letter E followed by a signed or unsigned integer.</p></li></ol><p>e.g. <code>32. +32.0 0.32E2</code> and <code>320.E-1</code> are all representations of 32.</p><p>The declaration <code>SCIENTIFIC_NOTATION</code> controls the output format of floating point numbers. At the default settings, any number with five or less digits before the decimal point is printed in a fixed-point notation, e.g., <code>12345.6</code>. Numbers with more than five digits are printed in scientific notation, e.g., <code>1.234567E+5</code>. Similarly, by default, any number with eleven or more zeros after the decimal point is printed in scientific notation. To change these defaults, <code>SCIENTIFIC_NOTATION</code> can be used in one of two ways.</p><pre><code class="language-Julia">reduce&gt; SCIENTIFIC_NOTATION m;</code></pre><p>where <code>m</code> is a positive integer, sets the printing format so that a number with more than <code>m</code> digits before the decimal point, or <code>m</code> or more zeros after the decimal point, is printed in scientific notation.</p><pre><code class="language-Julia">reduce&gt; SCIENTIFIC_NOTATION{m,n};</code></pre><p>with <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> both positive integers, sets the format so that a number with more than <code>m</code> digits before the decimal point, or <code>n</code> or more zeros after the decimal point is printed in scientific notation.</p><p><em>CAUTION:</em> The unsigned part of any number may <em>not</em> begin with a decimal point, as this causes confusion with the <code>CONS</code> (<code>.</code>) operator, i.e., <em>NOT ALLOWED ARE:</em> <code>.5 -.23 +.12</code>; use <code>0.5 -0.23 +0.12</code> instead.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".3-Identifiers-1" href="#.3-Identifiers-1">2.3 Identifiers</a></h2><p>Identifiers in REDUCE consist of one or more alphanumeric characters (i.e. alphabetic letters or decimal digits) the first of which must be alphabetic. The maximum number of characters allowed is implementation dependent, although twenty-four is permitted in most implementations. In addition, the underscore character <code>_</code> is considered a letter if it is <em>within</em> an identifier. For example,</p><pre><code class="language-none">a az p1 q23p  a_very_long_variable</code></pre><p>are all identifiers, whereas</p><pre><code class="language-none">_a</code></pre><p>is not.</p><p>A sequence of alphanumeric characters in which the first is a digit is interpreted as a product. For example, <code>2ab3c</code> is interpreted as <code>2*ab3c</code>. There is one exception to this: If the first letter after a digit is <code>E</code>, the system will try to interpret that part of the sequence as a real number, which may fail in some cases. For example, <code>2E12</code> is the real number <code>2.0 * 1012</code>, <code>2e3c</code> is <code>2000.0*C</code>, and <code>2ebc</code> gives an error.</p><p>Special characters, such as <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>&lt;blank&gt;</code>, may be used in identifiers too, even as the first character, but each must be preceded by an exclamation mark in input. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-none">light!-years    d!\*!\*n         good! morning  
!$sign          !5goldrings</code></pre><p><em>CAUTION:</em> Many system identifiers have such special characters in their names (especially <code>*</code> and <code>=</code>). If the user accidentally picks the name of one of them for his own purposes it may have catastrophic consequences for his REDUCE run. Users are therefore advised to avoid such names.</p><p>Identifiers are used as variables, labels and to name arrays, operators and procedures. Restrictions</p><p>The reserved words listed in section <a href="A-reserved.html#Appendix-A:-Reserved-Identifiers-1">Appendix A: Reserved Identifiers</a> may not be used as identifiers. No spaces may appear within an identifier, and an identifier may not extend over a line of text.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".4-Variables-1" href="#.4-Variables-1">2.4 Variables</a></h2><p>Every variable is named by an identifier, and is given a specific type. The type is of no concern to the ordinary user. Most variables are allowed to have the default type, called scalar. These can receive, as values, the representation of any ordinary algebraic expression. In the absence of such a value, they stand for themselves.</p><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="Reserved-Variables-1" href="#Reserved-Variables-1">Reserved Variables</a></h3><p>Several variables in REDUCE have particular properties which should not be changed by the user. These variables include:</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="CATALAN-1" href="#CATALAN-1">CATALAN</a></h4><pre><code class="language-none">Reduce.catalan</code></pre><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="E-1" href="#E-1">E</a></h4><p>Intended to represent the base of the natural logarithms. <code>log(e)</code>, if it occurs in an expression, is automatically replaced by 1. If <code>ROUNDED</code> is on, <code>E</code> is replaced by the value of <span>$e$</span> to the current degree of floating point precision.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="EULER_GAMMA-1" href="#EULER_GAMMA-1">EULER_GAMMA</a></h4><pre><code class="language-none">Reduce.euler_gamma</code></pre><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="GOLDEN_RATIO-1" href="#GOLDEN_RATIO-1">GOLDEN_RATIO</a></h4><p>The number <span>$\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$</span>.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="I-1" href="#I-1">I</a></h4><p>Intended to represent the square root of -1. <code>i^2</code> is replaced by -1, and appropriately for higher powers of <code>I</code>. This applies only to the symbol <code>I</code> used on the top level, not as a formal parameter in a procedure, a local variable, nor in the context <code>for i:= ...</code>.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="INFINITY-1" href="#INFINITY-1">INFINITY</a></h4><p>Intended to represent ∞ in limit and power series calculations for example, as well as in definite integration. Note however that the current system does not do proper arithmetic on ∞. For example, <code>infinity + infinity</code> is <code>2*infinity</code>.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="KHINCHIN-1" href="#KHINCHIN-1">KHINCHIN</a></h4><pre><code class="language-none">Reduce.khinchin</code></pre><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="NEGATIVE-1" href="#NEGATIVE-1">NEGATIVE</a></h4><p>Used in the Roots package.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="NIL-1" href="#NIL-1">NIL</a></h4><p>In REDUCE (algebraic mode only) taken as a synonym for zero. Therefore <code>NIL</code> cannot be used as a variable.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="PI-1" href="#PI-1">PI</a></h4><p>Intended to represent the circular constant. With <code>ROUNDED</code> on, it is replaced by the value of π to the current degree of floating point precision.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="POSITIVE-1" href="#POSITIVE-1">POSITIVE</a></h4><p>Used in the Roots package.</p><h4><a class="nav-anchor" id="T-1" href="#T-1">T</a></h4><p>Must not be used as a formal parameter or local variable in procedures, since conflict arises with the symbolic mode meaning of <code>T</code> as <em>true</em>.</p><p>Other reserved variables, such as <code>LOW_POW</code>, described in other sections, are listed in <a href="A-reserved.html#Appendix-A:-Reserved-Identifiers-1">Appendix A: Reserved Identifiers</a>.</p><p>Using these reserved variables inappropriately will lead to errors.</p><p>There are also internal variables used by REDUCE that have similar restrictions. These usually have an asterisk in their names, so it is unlikely a casual user would use one. An example of such a variable is <code>K!\*</code> used in the asymptotic command package.</p><p>Certain words are reserved in REDUCE. They may only be used in the manner intended. A list of these is given in the section “Reserved Identifiers”. There are, of course, an impossibly large number of such names to keep in mind. The reader may therefore want to make himself a copy of the list, deleting the names he doesn’t think he is likely to use by mistake.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".5-Strings-1" href="#.5-Strings-1">2.5 Strings</a></h2><p>Strings are used in <code>WRITE</code> statements, in other output statements (such as error messages), and to name files. A string consists of any number of characters enclosed in double quotes. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-Julia">~A String~</code></pre><p>Lower case characters within a string are not converted to upper case.</p><p>The string <code>~~</code> represents the empty string. A double quote may be included in a string by preceding it by another double quote. Thus <code>~a~~b~</code> is the string <code>a~b</code>, and <code>~~~~</code> is the string consisting of the single character <code>~</code>.</p><p><strong>Note that the Reduce.jl parser does not currently support REDUCE strings, as there is no need for them due to the native string support of the Julia language.</strong></p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".6-Comments-1" href="#.6-Comments-1">2.6 Comments</a></h2><p>Text can be included in program listings for the convenience of human readers, in such a way that REDUCE pays no attention to it. There are two ways to do this:</p><ol><li><p>Everything from the word <code>COMMENT</code> to the next statement terminator, normally <code>;</code> or <code>$</code>, is ignored. Such comments can be placed anywhere a blank could properly appear. (Note that <code>END</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> are not treated as <code>COMMENT</code> delimiters!)</p></li><li><p>Everything from the symbol <code>%</code> to the end of the line on which it appears is ignored. Such comments can be placed as the last part of any line. Statement terminators have no special meaning in such comments. Remember to put a semicolon before the <code>%</code> if the earlier part of the line is intended to be so terminated. Remember also to begin each line of a multi-line <code>%</code> comment with a <code>%</code> sign.</p></li></ol><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".7-Operators-1" href="#.7-Operators-1">2.7 Operators</a></h2><footer><hr/><a class="previous" href="01-introduction.html"><span class="direction">Previous</span><span class="title">1 Introductory Information</span></a><a class="next" href="03-expressions.html"><span class="direction">Next</span><span class="title">3 Expressions</span></a></footer></article></body></html>
